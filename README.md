This project consists from 3 part ,a server+database and a client. You can basicly rent cars manually or start the server and watch clients rent them.
One of most important things about this project is clients have the available car's data eventhough they never access to database. In RENTACARKUTUPHANE there are  serializable classes named IletisimPaketi and User. I used objets consisted from IletisimPaketi class which has plenty of property to transfer datas.
I think this project need Intermediate sql , Advanced C# and Sockets programming skills.
To use , you first have to set the connection text in dbmanager class up to connect your database than u will need to tables names users and arabalar
Coloumns for arabalar: ID(INT,AUTO INCREMENT) next are all txt DURUM,VERILIS,TESLIM,MARKA,MODEL,TELNO,TC,GUNLUKKIRA,TAHSILAT
For users: ID(AI , int) ,Isim, Tc,Telno,Pass,Online,Araclar
